Microsoft's New Movie Studio

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project was initiated by Microsoft Studio, which is a new movie production studio. They requested us to conduct a research, using other databases from other experienced movie production companies such as Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, The MovieDB and The Number, with the aim of guiding them on producing good movies which will succeed in the future. The fact that this is a new movie studio, they don’t have any knowledge on producing good movies that will succeed in future. So we’ll have to use the imported data, from other production studios, with the aim of determining the movies that they will use to produce other good movies. 

The main objective of this project is to analyze the current trends in the film industry by determining what types of films or movies that are currently succeeding at the box office. The findings will be used to give insights in making judgements regarding the type of movies that the Microsoft Company, which is a new studio, will produce.
Project goals include the following: -

   1. To investigate the current movie trends, in accordance to the Box Office Productions
   
   2. To examine the necessary statistics that will be used to determine the movies that are succeeding at the Box Office.
   
   3. To translate the findings into actionable insights that will be used by Microsoft Studio to make informed decisions to produce good movies.
   
   4. To provide recommendations on the types of films that are likely to be successful in the future.  
   

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Microsoft Studio has made a decision to launch a new movie studio and enter into the film business industry. They don't have the skills or the expertise to make successful movies that will help them to earn more profits like other production companies at the Box Office. They must comprehend the current trends and tastes of movies, that will be liked by their targeted consumers, in order to make wise selections regarding the kinds of movies to produce. 

This project's goal and objective is to investigate the kinds of movies that are currently doing well at the Box Office and offer useful information that Microsoft can use to decide what kinds of movies to make. 
In order to determine the most popular genres, actors, directors, and other elements that influence a film's industry success, the project will involve evaluating movie data. 

DATA UNDERSTANDING

Data Sources

In this project, we used data from other movie and film production companies, such as Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and The MovieDB. These data samples were imported into our databases of which we used them to determine the current movies and the genres that are currently doing well in the market. The data contains movie title, the studio production, domestic gross, foreign gross, the year that they were produced and the number of votes and reviews that were reviewed by their targeted consumers after watching them. 

Data Quality

During the importation of our data into our database, issues like  missing data, duplicates were encountered. First, I had to clean the data by removing duplicates and taking care of missing data and this helped me to improve the quality of the data from our sources. 

BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS

- I would like to recommend Microsoft to produce the movies like The Monkey King 3[2018] since it has earned the other production companies with over $114 million of which this will earn, the new Microsoft studio, more profits as compared to other movies.
 
- I would like to recommend Microsoft studio to produce more of Drama and Action movies and series since they have been performing well over the years and this will attract more audience from all over the world.

- I would also like to recommend Microsoft studio to produce other movies like Kid with a bike, Desiert, Once Upon A time in Anatolia and BarberShop: The Next Cut since they are likely to do well in the future after having a lot of experiences over the years like other movie production companies.
